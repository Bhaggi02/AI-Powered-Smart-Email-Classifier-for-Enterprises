Week 1 – Data Collection & Preprocessing

AI Powered Smart Email Classifier for Enterprises

📌 Week 1 Overview
Week 1 focuses on building a **strong data foundation** for the project. The objective of this week is to collect historical email data, clean and preprocess the text, and create a labeled dataset that can be used for training machine learning models in later stages.

This step is critical because the performance of NLP and ML models heavily depends on the quality of the data.
🎯 Week 1 Objectives
Collect historical or publicly available email datasets
Clean and normalize raw email text
Remove noise such as HTML tags, signatures, and stopwords
Label emails with categories and urgency levels
 Prepare a machine-learning-ready dataset

🧩 Module Implemented (Week 1)
🔹 Module 1: Email Data Collection & Preprocessing
1. Email Data Collection
Collected email data using CSV files
 Used publicly available or sample email datasets
 Loaded datasets into the system using Pandas in Google Colab

 2. Email Preprocessing
The raw email text was cleaned and standardized using Natural Language Processing techniques.
Preprocessing steps include:
Converting text to lowercase
Removing HTML tags and URLs
Removing email signatures (e.g., Regards, Thanks)
Removing special characters and numbers
Removing stopwords using NLTK
Applying lemmatization to normalize words
   This ensures consistent and meaningful text representation for model training.

3. Cleaned Email Generation
A new column `clean_email` was created containing preprocessed email text
This column serves as the primary input for machine learning models

 4. Email Categorization (Labeling)
Emails were labeled into the following categories:
Complaints, Requests, Feedback, Spam

This labeling enables supervised learning for email classification in future weeks.

5. Urgency Tagging
Each email was assigned an urgency level based on content analysis.
Urgency levels:  High, Medium, Low
Keyword-based logic was used to identify urgency indicators such as *urgent*, *asap*, and *immediately*.

🧩 Module Implemented
🔹 Module 3: Urgency Detection & Scoring

🔍 Key Activities Performed
Urgency Level Definition
Each email was classified into one of the following urgency levels:
High – Immediate action required (system failures, service outages)
Medium – Important but not time-critical
Low – Informational or general communication

Rule-Based Urgency Detection
A keyword-based approach was implemented to detect urgency signals such as:
(urgent,asap,immediately,not working,failure)
This method ensures instant detection of clearly critical emails.

Machine Learning-Based Urgency Prediction
A supervised learning model was trained on labeled urgency data to predict urgency levels based on email content patterns.

Hybrid Urgency Scoring
The final urgency decision was derived by combining:
Rule-based keyword detection
ML-based prediction

This hybrid approach improved accuracy and reduced false urgency classification.

📊 Model Evaluation
Urgency prediction performance was evaluated using:
Precision,Recall,F1 Score,Confusion Matrix
This ensured balanced classification across all urgency levels.

📦 Milestone 3 Deliverables
Urgency detection module
Rule-based urgency logic
Trained urgency classification model
Evaluated urgency prediction results
Dataset enriched with urgency tags

🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Environment: Google Colab
